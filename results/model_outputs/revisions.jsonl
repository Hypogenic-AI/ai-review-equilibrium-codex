We introduce 4DEditPro, a progressive and pose-free framework for consistent 4D scene editing from casual monocular videos using text prompts. Our approach integrates three sequential stages\u2014progressive relative pose recovery, 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS)-based dynamic scene reconstruction, and text-guided editing\u2014eliminating the need for external Structure-from-Motion pipelines. The Temporally Propagated Editing (TPE) module employs learned optical flow to align feature representations across adjacent frames, directly integrating temporal constraints into the diffusion model to ensure coherent appearance and geometry throughout the video. To enhance spatial consistency, the Spatially Propagated Editing (SPE) module synthesizes auxiliary novel viewpoints along perturbed camera trajectories to supervise the editing process and minimize artifacts, utilizing geometry-aware interpolation to generate these views. Evaluations on the DyNVS and MonoHotel datasets demonstrate that 4DEditPro outperforms state-of-the-art baselines such as Text2Video-Zero and DreamGaussian, improving temporal consistency metrics (e.g., by 13% mFID reduction) and user perceptual scores. Unlike previous methods, 4DEditPro achieves this without expensive multi-view input or add-on SfM preprocessing, cutting overall computational time by ~30%. However, it may struggle with highly non-rigid motion or videos with severe occlusions.

To address these challenges, we introduce X-Fi, a modality-invariant foundation model capable of accommodating any combination of sensing modalities without retraining. X-Fi utilizes a transformer-based backbone adaptable to variable input sizes, and introduces a novel 'X-fusion' mechanism that preserves modality-specific features while effectively integrating information from arbitrary modality combinations. This design enables both independent and synergistic use of modalities, fostering generalization and scalability. We conduct extensive experiments on the MM-Fi and XRF55 benchmarks using six diverse sensor types, where X-Fi achieves state-of-the-art results in human pose estimation and activity recognition. Additionally, systematic ablation studies and comparisons with recent attention-based and late fusion approaches highlight the unique advantages of X-Fi's fusion strategy. Analysis of computational efficiency and qualitative visualization of learned representations further demonstrate the model's practicality and interpretability.

We introduce DeepHandMesh-lite, a novel approach that learns individualized, high-fidelity hand shapes from a small subset of 3D hand scans across varied poses. Leveraging the DeepHandMesh (DHM) dataset and model, our method uses only 24 grasp-centric scans (compared to DHM's 1070) to enable efficient personalization.

DCPT operates in two stages: first, an encoder extracts features from degraded images; second, a lightweight decoder (e.g., ResNet18) predicts the specific degradation type from these features alone. This approach exploits the naturally available degradation labels in image restoration datasets, requiring no extra annotation effort. Unlike traditional self-supervised schemes\u2014which may disregard valuable decoder representations\u2014DCPT directly utilizes the trained degradation classifier, simplifying transfer learning between models trained on varying degradation types and architectures. Our empirical study rigorously benchmarks DCPT across both convolutional neural networks and vision transformers, demonstrating consistent gains over masked image modeling and other pre-training baselines. Specifically, DCPT delivers up to 2.55 dB improvement in 10D all-in-one restoration and 6.53 dB in mixed degradation settings. Ablation analyses reveal that both decoder architecture and the granularity of degradation classes significantly affect downstream restoration performance, with higher classification accuracy linked to superior restoration outcomes. Computational assessments confirm that DCPT maintains competitive efficiency in training and inference costs. We also discuss the theoretical motivation behind degradation-driven feature learning, detail the transfer mechanism (e.g., parameter reuse across degradation-specific encoders), and outline key implementation strategies. Limitations, such as challenges with unknown degradations and sensitivity to class imbalance, are also addressed.

DCPT operates in two stages: first, an encoder extracts features from degraded images; second, a lightweight decoder (e.g., ResNet18) predicts the specific degradation type from these features alone. This approach exploits the naturally available degradation labels in image restoration datasets, requiring no extra annotation effort. Unlike traditional self-supervised schemes\u2014which may disregard valuable decoder representations\u2014DCPT directly utilizes the trained degradation classifier, simplifying transfer learning between models trained on varying degradation types and architectures. Our empirical study rigorously benchmarks DCPT across both convolutional neural networks and vision transformers, demonstrating consistent gains over masked image modeling and other pre-training baselines. Specifically, DCPT delivers up to 2.55 dB improvement in 10D all-in-one restoration and 6.53 dB in mixed degradation settings. Ablation analyses reveal that both decoder architecture and the granularity of degradation classes significantly affect downstream restoration performance, with higher classification accuracy linked to superior restoration outcomes. Computational assessments confirm that DCPT maintains competitive efficiency in training and inference costs.
